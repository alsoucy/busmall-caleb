USER STORIES

As a marketer, I want an app that will allow me to collect accurate data about which products my market is interested in buying. I want that app to show members of a focus group catalog-style photos of several products at a time, and allow them to select the photo of the product they are most interested in.

As a marketer, I want an app with a clean and simple design that is attractive but subtle, and that puts the focus on the products (a bare page with no styling might be functional for the purposes of collecting data, but I believe that focus group participants will respond better to nicely-styled app, however minimalist, than no styling at all).

As a marketer, I want an intuitive UI for my app that will not make focus group participants think about how to use it; it should be obvious and easy.

As a marketer, I want to be able to see a graphical rendering of the results data. Again, the design should be clean and easy-to-read, and any steps I have to take (navigations, buttons, forms) should be intuitive, easy to understand, and following basic usability principles.
