BUSMALL, a market research app demo by Caleb Sattgast.

USER STORIES

As a marketer, I want an app that will allow me to collect accurate data about which products my market is interested in buying. I want that app to show members of a focus group catalog-style photos of several products at a time, and allow them to select the photo of the product they are most interested in.

As a marketer, I want an app with a clean and simple design that is attractive but subtle, and that puts the focus on the products (a bare page with no styling might be functional for the purposes of collecting data, but I believe that focus group participants will respond better to nicely-styled app, however minimalist, than no styling at all).

As a marketer, I want an intuitive user interface for my app that will not require focus group participants to stop and think about how to use it; it should be obvious and easy.

As a marketer, I want to be able to see a graphical rendering of the results data. Again, the design should be clean and easy-to-read, and any steps I have to take (navigations, buttons, forms) should be intuitive, easy to understand, and following basic usability principles.

As a marketer interested in how people interact with my website and my product offers, I also want to give the user a chance to view the results of their product votes after 15 rounds of voting. I want data showing the numbers and percentages for how many of the focus group participants viewed their results.

As a developer, I want to write an app that displays a random series of images from a set, 3 at a time, and allow the end user (the focus group participant) to vote on their favorite image by clicking on it. I want to insure that 3 unique images are displayed each time.

As a developer, I want my code to capture and record the clicks on images from the end user's votes, and use the data to calculate how popular each image is. I want my data generated in my voting app to be accessible to a separate javascript app that displays the results graphically on a web page to the marketers conducting this research project.

As a developer, I want to code an app that is not only functional, but elegant and simple for the end users (both market researchers and focus group participants) to understand and use. I want to follow basic principles of usability when building my user interface.

As a focus group participant, I'm up for taking an interesting survey about some potentially cool widgets, but as I am a busy person, I want it to take no more than a few minutes of my time, and I want it to run smoothly and to not have to think about how to use it. If I do, you probably have 10 seconds max for me to figure it out or I will get frustrated, ditch out of it and move on to the next interesting post on Facebook.
